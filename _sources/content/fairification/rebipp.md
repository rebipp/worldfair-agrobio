# Brazilian Network on Plant-Pollinator Interactions (REBIPP)

The [Brazilian Network on Plant-Pollinator Interactions](https://db.rebipp.org.br) (REBIPP) is a collaborative network of experts in Pollination Biology who study plant-pollinator interactions in their various dimensions and aims to encourage the development of scientific and educational activities in the area.

REBIPP provides a platform to retrieve and publish datasets on interactions between plants and their floral visitors, such as pollinators.

Data publication in REBIPP involves filling data into a spreadsheet with predefiined format (template). This template includes:

- A sheet for metadata description which follows the EML standard,
- A sheet for interaction records between plants and animals following the Darwin Core standard,
- A sheet with a glossary of terms to help users to find term definitions and examples of use.

General instructions for publishing data into REBIPP can be found at [http://db.rebipp.org.br/how-to-contribute](http://db.rebipp.org.br/how-to-contribute).

## The REBIPP Template

In order to simplify (meta)data standardization REBIPP provides a template spreadsheet with metadata and data sheets.
To create a copy of the template use the link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z2mvs6Bm7fE5IhxPRVbh1ieEfKsVKeIiK_mitPqvPJw/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z2mvs6Bm7fE5IhxPRVbh1ieEfKsVKeIiK_mitPqvPJw/copy).

Once you have copied the template, fill the spreadsheet with your data and metadata following the column definitions. **It is not necessary to fill in all columns. Only fill in those for which you have data**.


## Request dataset publication

The REBIPP does not provide an automated process to publish data. Instead, you must copy the URL (link) of your spreadsheet and submit to [rebipp2016@gmail.com](mailto:rebipp2016@gmail.com) for review.

The database curator will review your dataset and if everything is fine, it will be published into the [REBIPP Database](https://db.rebipp.org.br).

## Persistent Identifier

At the moment, REBIPP does not generate PIDs for published datasets.
