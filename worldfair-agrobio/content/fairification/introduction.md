# FAIRification process

The "FAIRification" is the process of transforming non-FAIR data into data which follows the four FAIR principles presented in chapter [FAIR Principles](fair-principles).
The "FAIRification" process, as presented here, is composed by `four` steps (Figure 1):

- **[Data standardization](data-std)**: is the transformation of original data (non-FAIR) using a `formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation` by the adotion of data `vocabularies that follow FAIR principles` and include `qualified references to other data`.
+++
- **Metadata standardization**: is the description of metadata using a `formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation` by adoption of metadata standards.
+++
- **Assign license**: choosing and assigning a lincense for the dataset and documenting it using `FAIR resources`.
+++
- **Deploy and Publishing data**: preparing data to be published in a `FAIR enabled data repository`.


```{warning}
Although license information is part of the metadata, we have incorporated the license assignment as a separate step in the FAIRification process to highlight its importance. The absence of an explicit license may prevent others to reuse data, even if the data is intended to be open access.
```

```{note}
Deploying and publishing your data is optional for non-open/private datasets. But metadata **MUST** be deployed and published.
